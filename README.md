## About
**QuidPHP/Main** is a PHP library that provides a set of base objects and collections that can be extended to build something more specific. It is part of the [QuidPHP](https://github.com/quidphp/project) package and can also be used standalone. 

## License
**QuidPHP/Main** is available as an open-source software under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Documentation

``` bash
$ composer require quidphp/main
```
Once installed, the **Quid\Main** namespace will be available within your PHP application.

## Requirement
**QuidPHP/Main** requires the following:
- PHP 8.1
- All requirements of [quidphp/base](https://github.com/quidphp/base)

## Dependency
**QuidPHP/Main** has the following dependency:
- [quidphp/base](https://github.com/quidphp/base) -Â Quid\Base - PHP library that provides a set of low-level static methods

The dependency will be resolved by using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installation process.

## Comment
**QuidPHP/Main** code is commented and all methods are explained (in French).

## Convention
**QuidPHP/Main** is built on the following conventions:
- *Coding*: No curly braces are used in a IF statement if the condition can be resolved in only one statement.
- *Config*: A special $config static property exists in all classes. This property gets recursively merged with the parents' property on initialization.
- *Dynamic*: Classes are dynamic and objects need to be instantiated, very few static methods
- *Interfaces*: Interfaces are stored within the Contract subdirectory.
- *Traits*: Traits filenames start with an underscore (_).
- *Type*: Files, function arguments and return types are strict typed.
