## About
**QuidPHP/Main** is a PHP library that provides a set of base objects and collections that can be extended to build something more specific. It is part of the [QuidPHP](https://github.com/quidphp/project) package and can also be used standalone. 

## License
**QuidPHP/Main** is available as an open-source software under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Documentation
**QuidPHP/Main** documentation is being written. Once ready, it will be available at https://quidphp.github.io/project.

## Installation
**QuidPHP/Main** can be easily installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). It is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/quidphp/main).
``` bash
$ composer require quidphp/main
```
Once installed, the **Quid\Main** namespace will be available within your PHP application.

## Requirement
**QuidPHP/Main** requires the following:
- PHP 7.2+ with fileinfo, curl and openssl

## Dependency
**QuidPHP/Main** has the following dependency:
- [quidphp/base](https://github.com/quidphp/base) |Â Quid\Base - PHP library that provides a set of low-level static methods

The dependency will be resolved by using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installation process.

## Comment
**QuidPHP/Main** code is commented and all methods are explained. However, most of the comments are currently written in French.

## Convention
**QuidPHP/Main** is built on the following conventions:
- *Traits*: Traits filenames start with an underscore (_).
- *Interfaces*: Interfaces are stored within the Contract subdirectory.
- *Coding*: No curly braces are used in a IF statement if the condition can be resolved in only one statement.
- *Type*: Files, function arguments and return types are strict typed.
- *Dynamic*: Classes are dynamic and objects need to be instantiated, very few static methods
- *Config*: A special $config static property exists in all classes. This property gets recursively merged with the parents' property on initialization.
